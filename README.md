= Usage
To add this tap to homebrew:
    brew tap richie765/formulas
    
= v8 formulas
The formulas with format `v8-3.14.5` will install exactly that version, usually the latest patchlevel that is available.

The formulas with format `v8-314` will install (one of) the latest builds of version 3.14.

= todo formulas
The formulas ending with `-todo` are the ones I'm still working on. They may or may not work. When they are finished, they may loose the `-todo` suffix and I may move them to the official homebrew repository.
